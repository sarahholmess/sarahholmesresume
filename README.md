basic starting file structure for Umass Dartmouth


I had to use a lot of unordered lists with list items for all of my catergories. I mostly kept consistent font weights except for the header and personal
information ("h" and "p" respectively). I kept the background pink with a dark grey text to keep myself seperate from other resumes. It is enough of a contrast
to easily read but provides the reader with no eye strain. I only used h2 to style my name, and to keep it the largest element in the resume.
I have had an extremely difficult itme working with my skills chart (the SVG file). I finally decided it would be best to keep it as is right below my skills list.
I am very excited to know that it looks entirely professional while still keeping the pink color. I had to add margins inbetween the two columns because
at certain points it was getting too close to the other column which can cause sentences to line up and the reader to be confused. The format changes when
you change the size of the window, at less that 650 pixels width, it will transform into one column to make it easier for mobile reading.
